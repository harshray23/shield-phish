## Core Features:

- URL Analysis: Analyze website URLs for suspicious patterns using regular expressions and known phishing indicators.

- SSL Certificate Verification: Validate SSL certificate details to ensure they are valid and not self-signed, reporting any anomalies such as expired certificates or domain mismatches.
- Real-time Detection Alerts: Provide immediate alerts upon detection of a potentially malicious website, notifying users and blocking access to prevent credential theft.
- Phishing Pattern Learning: Continuously update machine learning models using datasets like PhishTank and Kaggle to improve detection accuracy and adapt to new phishing techniques.
- User Interface (Web/Browser): Offer a web or browser-based interface for users to submit URLs for analysis and view results.
